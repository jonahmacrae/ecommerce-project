# eCommerce Project

A more advanced practice project for building with React.

## Purpose

This project is designed to deepen my understanding of React by developing a more complex, feature-rich eCommerce application. It builds on the fundamentals explored in my earlier chatbot project and introduces more advanced concepts such as component architecture, state management, routing, and dynamic data handling.
